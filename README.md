I'm really tired recently. I spent nearly an hour and a half asking questions today. In fact, I still don't know how to write my resume. I only know a little fur. It's very uncomfortable. Today, I finally completed the fifth stage of the book city. It really took me a lot of time. When I wrote JSP later, I really wanted to die. Fortunately, the front and back ends are separated now, We don't have to do many things. What we're talking about today is actually confused and not very clear. I'll see it later. Now I'll take these things first. The pressure is really great. This English exam really gives me a headache. Now I find that I really don't like the front end at all. The front end looks so complex, but I don't study it in depth. I just know a little about the front end, There's still a long way to go. GitHub hasn't been updated in recent days. Maybe there's nothing to write about. However, there's a big project about the book city behind. There are many files. I think of a way to write it as a project. It's better, ha ha
